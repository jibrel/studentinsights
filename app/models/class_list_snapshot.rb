  # Look at actual substantive diffs in students_json across workspaces.

  # This means that the list of students can drift from revisiont to revision
  # as students are added or withdrawn, which the snapshotting code handles
  # by conversatively snapshotting each revision independently.
  # So when looking at data, as revisions are made, they are snapshotted
  # independently, which means there are more snapshot records
  # than there would be if we were snapshotting the workspace itself.

  # Returns a list of diffs across workspaces where there are multiple
  # snapshots.  These may be empty, reflecting that the snapshotting
  # was conservative and generated at the time of the revision.
