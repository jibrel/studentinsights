# Serializes to JSON with personally-identifiable information stripped out.
#
# Intended to be used for sharing with folks who are already working on
# the project and have signed a data sharing agreement, so that they
# can do analysis without granting access to production systems or
# personally-identifiable information.
#
# Keep in mind that if the numbers of students is small, when joined with
# with local knowledge that people in the school or community may have,
# people may be able to make inferences about this data set (eg., if there
# is only one student who is of a particular race/gender combination in a
# particular class).
#
# In other words, this is still highly sensitive information should never
# be shared with folks who don't have a direct need to access it for the
# project, and should still be transmitted securely.  If you're looking for
# a way to share data for development purposes, use the seed tasks instead.
# If you're looking for how to make the seed data more realistic, work towards
# improving the seed tasks rather than working from any data generated with
# this class.
#
# Example:
#
#   anon = UnsafeAnonymizer.new
#   students = Student.all.map {|student| anon.student(student) };nil
#   schools = School.all.map {|school| anon.school(school) };nil
#   absences = Absence.all.map {|absence| anon.absence(absence) };nil
#   service_types = anon.all_service_types;nil
#   student_for_absence_dashboard = Student.all.map {|student| anon.student_for_absence_dashboard(student) };nil
#
#
#   # only particular services
#   relevant_service_type_ids = [509, 510, 511, 512, 513]
#   relevant_services = Service.all.select do |service|
#     relevant_service_type_ids.include?(service.service_type_id)
#   end;nil
#   services = relevant_services.map {|service| anon.service(service) };nil
